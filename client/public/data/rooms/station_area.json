Between the rings float crystalline structures that pulse with inner light, shifting through colors that don't quite exist in normal spectrum. The entire assembly hums with barely contained power, a sound you feel in your bones more than hear.\n\nThe energy field around the anchor distorts space itself. Light bends at strange angles, sounds echo in impossible ways, and your perception constantly shifts as if reality is struggling to maintain coherence near the device. This is clearly technology far beyond conventional understanding—perhaps reverse-engineered from something not originally human.\n\nControl interfaces surround the anchor's base, displaying incomprehensible data streams and energy readings. The station's designers built this entire facility around this single device.
